; Given a value N, if we want to make change for N cents, and we have infinite 
; supply of each of S = { S1, S2, .. , Sm} valued coins, how many ways can 
; we make the change? The order of coins doesnâ€™t matter.

; For example, for N = 4 and S = {1,2,3}, there are four solutions: 
; {1,1,1,1},{1,1,2},{2,2},{1,3}. So output should be 4. 
; For N = 10 and S = {2, 5, 3, 6}, there are five solutions: 
; {2,2,2,2,2}, {2,2,3,3}, {2,2,6}, {2,3,5} and {5,5}. 
; So the output should be 5.

; Combination with repetition
